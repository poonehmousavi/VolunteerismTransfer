Please Donate for the Affected'': Supporting Emergency Managers in Finding Volunteers and Donations in Twitter Across Disasters

Despite the outpouring of social support posted to social media channels in the aftermath of disaster, finding and managing content that can translate into community relief, donations, volunteering, or other recovery support is difficult. This paper outlines methods for providing computational support in this emergency support function by evaluating the consistency of language in volunteer- and donation-related social media content across 31 disasters and developing semi-automated models for classifying volunteer- and donation-related social media content in new disaster events. Results show volunteer- and donation-related social media content is sufficiently similar across disaster events and disaster types to warrant transferring models across disasters, and we describe a simple resampling technique for tuning these models for specific types of disasters. We then introduce and evaluate a weak-supervision approach to integrate domain knowledge from emergency response officers with machine learning models to improve classification accuracy and accelerate this emergency support in new events.
